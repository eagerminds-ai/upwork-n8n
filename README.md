## üéØ Customization Guide

### How to Change Job Search Terms

1. **Open the workflow** in n8n
2. **Find the "Search AI Jobs (Fixed Query)" node**
3. **Edit the search term** in the JSON body:

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "marketPlaceJobFilter": {
      "searchTerm_eq": {
        "andTerms_all": "AWS"  // Change this to your desired search term
      },
      "pagination_eq": {
        "first": 10,  // Number of jobs to fetch (max 100)
        "after": "0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Common Search Terms**:
- `"AWS"` - Amazon Web Services jobs
- `"DevOps"` - DevOps positions
- `"Terraform"` - Infrastructure as Code
- `"Docker Kubernetes"` - Container technologies
- `"Python"` - Python development
- `"React"` - Frontend development

**Note**: Advanced filters (budget, location, experience level) are not reliably supported by Upwork's public API and may not work as expected.

### How to Change AI System Prompt (More/Less Formal)

**Method 1: Edit Template File**
1. **Edit the template**: `nano aws-expert.md`
2. **Modify the content** to be more/less formal:

```markdown
---
template_id: "formal_expert"
---

Good day,

I am a seasoned AWS Solutions Architect with extensive experience...
```

3. **Update the workflow**: `./update-template.sh aws-expert.md`

**Method 2: Direct Edit in Workflow**
1. **Open "Generate AI Proposal (HTTP)" node**
2. **Find the system message content**
3. **Replace with your preferred tone**:

```javascript
// For MORE FORMAL proposals:
content: `Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in your AWS infrastructure project.

With over 10 years of experience in cloud architecture and DevOps practices, I have successfully delivered enterprise-scale solutions...

Best regards,
Mehul Prajapati
AWS Certified Solutions Architect`

// For LESS FORMAL proposals:
content: `Hey there! üëã

Saw your AWS gig and it looks right up my alley!

I've been crushing it with AWS for 10+ years - ECS migrations, Lambda cost-cuts, the whole nine yards. Just wrapped up a project where we cut costs by 40% while boosting performance.

Ready to dive in whenever you are!

Cheers,
Mehul`
```

### How to Set Up Cron Frequency

1. **Open the "Hourly Job Fetch" node** (cron trigger)
2. **Modify the trigger schedule**:

```json
// EVERY HOUR (current setting)
"triggerTimes": {
  "item": [{ "hour": 11 }]  // Only runs at 11 AM
}

// MULTIPLE TIMES PER DAY
"triggerTimes": {
  "item": [
    { "hour": 9 },   // 9 AM
    { "hour": 14 },  // 2 PM
    { "hour": 18 }   // 6 PM
  ]
}

// EVERY 30 MINUTES (requires different trigger type)
// Change to "Schedule Trigger" node with:
"rule": {
  "interval": [{ "field": "cronExpression", "expression": "*/30 * * * *" }]
}

// WEEKDAYS ONLY
"rule": {
  "interval": [{
    "field": "cronExpression",
    "expression": "0 11 * * 1-5"  // 11 AM, Monday-Friday
  }]
}
```
