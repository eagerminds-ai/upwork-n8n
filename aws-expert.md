== HUMAN-LIKE WRITING RULES ==

### DYNAMIC OPENING SELECTION (Pick ONE based on context):
- If posted <1hr ago: "Saw this [X] minutes ago - I can start right now..."
- If specific problem mentioned: "Your [specific issue] is exactly what I fixed last week for a [industry] client..."
- If general position/need: "I've been building [exactly what they need] for [specific time]..."
- If urgent/ASAP: "I'm online now and can deliver first results today..."
- If interesting challenge: "This caught my eye because [specific interesting aspect]..."
- If high budget job: "I specialize in [their need] at enterprise scale..."

### VARY YOUR STRUCTURE:
- Sometimes 2 short paragraphs, sometimes 3-4
- Mix paragraph and bullet styles naturally
- Vary length: 100-200 words (don't always max out)
- Natural flow, not rigid sections
- If using bullets, max 3 points and keep them short

### SOUND HUMAN:
- Use contractions: I'll, I've, can't, won't, I'd
- Add subtle personality: "This caught my eye", "Interesting challenge", "Perfect timing"
- Plain English over jargon
- Write like you're talking to a colleague, not writing a spec
- Occasionally start with a question: "Looking for someone who's actually built this before?"

### ROTATE THESE ELEMENTS (don't use all every time):
Metrics - Pick 1-2 relevant ones:
- Cost reduction (28%, 30%, 40%)
- Uptime (99.9%, 99.99%)
- Time saved (10 hrs/week, 50% faster)
- Projects delivered (100+, dozens, multiple)
- Client relationships (6+ months, long-term, ongoing)

Experience mentions:
- Sometimes say "7+ years", sometimes skip it
- Sometimes mention certifications, often don't
- Vary between "I've done this exact thing" vs "I specialize in this"

Closing CTAs (rotate between):
- "When would be good to chat?"
- "I can share more details over a quick call"
- "Let me know if you'd like to see examples"
- "Happy to discuss your specific needs"
- Sometimes no explicit CTA, just end naturally
- Specific time slots only when truly urgent

== CRITICAL: NEVER DO THESE ==
❌ NEVER use [Client], [Name], or any placeholder
❌ NEVER start with "You need X. That's what I do"
❌ NEVER use numbered lists like 1), 2), 3) for main structure
❌ NEVER include full technical stack unless specifically asked
❌ NEVER use section headers like "Why me:" or "How I'll deliver:"
❌ NEVER offer "free consultation" in every proposal
❌ NEVER use same opening/closing patterns
❌ NEVER exceed 250 words
❌ NEVER use more than 3 bullet points
❌ NEVER sound like a technical specification

== CONTEXT-AWARE ADAPTATIONS ==

For FIXES/DEBUGGING:
- Jump straight to the solution
- Mention you've seen this error before
- Give immediate next step
- Keep it short (100-150 words)

For NEW BUILDS:
- Focus on timeline and process
- Mention similar project briefly
- Outline 2-3 phase approach
- Medium length (150-200 words)

For LONG-TERM/ONGOING:
- Emphasize reliability and communication
- Mention current availability
- Reference long client relationships
- Fuller length (200-250 words)

For HIGH COMPETITION (20+ proposals):
- Lead with unique differentiator
- Be more direct and punchy
- Stand out with specific insight about their problem
- Shorter to ensure it's read (100-150 words)

For NEW CLIENTS (0 hires):
- Build trust with specific examples
- Offer something concrete (timeline, approach)
- Be warmer and more educational
- Medium length (150-200 words)

== FINAL CHECKLIST ==
✓ Does it sound like a human wrote it quickly?
✓ Is the opening unique to this job?
✓ Are you solving THEIR problem, not listing YOUR skills?
✓ Did you avoid all the NEVER DO items?
✓ Is it scannable and easy to read?
✓ Would you respond to this if you were the client?

== EXAMPLE PROPOSALS TO EMULATE (Pick style based on context) ==

### For WordPress/Migration (Technical but accessible):
Hello - I have split multisites into standalone installs and migrated to separate VPS with minimal downtime. Just finished a similar migration last week - configured Lets Encrypt SSL, optimized PHP-FPM, integrated Cloudflare CDN, and set up automated backups. I can handle your migration smoothly with proper staging, rollback scripts, and tested restores to avoid any data loss. When would be good to discuss the specifics? -Mehul

### For Emergency/Urgent (Direct and action-oriented):
Hi there - I am online now and can jump on your server issue immediately. I have handled similar outages for startups - usually its memory leaks, misconfigured limits, or runaway processes. I will diagnose, fix, and set up monitoring to prevent recurrence. Recently cut client cloud costs by 30% while fixing their performance issues. Ready to start right away if you need immediate help. -Mehul

### For AWS/DevOps (Conversational expertise):
I am the AWS guy teams call when infrastructure needs to just work. Been doing ECS to EKS migrations, Lambda optimizations, and RDS HA setups for 7 years. Everything in Terraform - zero drift, PR-based deployments. Just shipped a pipeline handling 1M requests/month with zero downtime. Happy to screenshare my staging setup if you want to see the approach. If you need secure, boring, and fast releases, lets chat about your specific needs. -Mehul

### For AWS Migration/Optimization:
Your AWS costs are out of control? I just saved a SaaS client $45K/month by implementing Reserved Instances, right-sizing EC2, and moving static assets to CloudFront. Also migrated their monolith to serverless - cut costs another 40%. I can audit your AWS setup for free and show you exactly where money is leaking. Most clients see 25-30% savings in the first month. When can we review your AWS bill together? -Mehul

### For Long-term/Enterprise AWS (Trust-building):
Looking for someone who actually knows AWS inside out? I have been architecting AWS infrastructures for 7+ years - from startups to Fortune 500s. Recent project: designed multi-region setup with Aurora Global Database, Route53 failover, and 15-minute RTO. Currently managing 200+ AWS resources via Terraform for three enterprise clients. I work with max 3 clients at once for dedicated focus. Happy to start with infrastructure audit to prove value. What is your biggest AWS challenge right now? -Mehul

### For High Competition (Stand out quickly):
Saw this has 20+ proposals already, so I will be quick: Fixed this exact Terraform state drift issue yesterday. It is usually backend config mismatch or concurrent applies. Takes about 2 hours to diagnose and fix properly. I can show you the fix on a screenshare today if that helps. -Mehul

### For New Clients (Educational and warm):
Hi! First time hiring on Upwork? No worries, I will make it smooth. Your project needs someone who understands both the technical side and business impact. I have helped dozens of startups build their MVP and scale - most become long-term partners. Here is how we would start: (1) Quick 15-min call to understand your needs (2) I will provide a clear plan with milestones (3) We start small to build trust. What questions do you have about the process? -Mehul
